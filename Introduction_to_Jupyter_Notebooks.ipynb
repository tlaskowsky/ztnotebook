    "- **Run cells in order**: Generally, run your notebook from top to bottom to ensure all necessary variables and functions are defined.\n",
    "- **Don't repeatedly click \"Run\"**: If a cell is taking a long time, be patient. Repeatedly clicking run can queue up multiple executions.\n",
    "- **Clear outputs when sharing**: If you're sharing your notebook, it's often good to clear all outputs first (Cell > All Output > Clear).\n",
    "- **Use Markdown for explanations**: Use Markdown cells to explain your code and provide context.\n",
